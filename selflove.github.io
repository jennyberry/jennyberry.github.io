   <h2>Level 1 – Do you treat yourself like someone you love? </h2>

The complicated relationship between feelings and actions. One of the secrets of human behavior is that how we feel and how we behave act reciprocally upon one another. In other words, if you treat yourself like shit, you’ll feel like shit. If you treat yourself like an amazing person, you’ll feel like an amazing person.
Pause and take inventory of the actions that you perform throughout the day. Are they reflective of the actions you would take if you truly loved yourself?
For most, the answer is no. Most people don’t get enough sleep or exercise, have crappy diets, work in jobs they hate, and go to great lengths to avoid spending any real time in their own company.
You can take a huge step forward by treating yourself as though you are intrinsically worthy of love. By creating the behaviors and signals that you are in fact an amazing human you’ll notice that you begin to feel that way.
There is no prescriptive blend of behaviors that works for everyone. However the actions below are unusually effective and worth experimenting with. You’ll notice that none of them are obscure or complicated. In fact, they are common. Don’t dismiss these ideas simply because you’ve heard them before. Instead try one or two. Take the risk of treating yourself well and see what happens.
